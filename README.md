This repository provides details of my paper **FerNeXt** model for facial expression recognition, as presented in the paper "[FerNeXt: Facial Expression Recognition Using ConvNeXt with Channel Attention](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278345)" (IEEE _MIUCC Conference_) , 2024).

## Overview
**Abstract**: 

This paper proposes FerNeXt, a facial expression recognition method based on the ConvNeXt architecture, enhanced with an 
Efficient Channel Attention(ECA) block to improve feature focus. An Affinity loss function is introduced to optimize class 
separability. The method was evaluated on the AffectNet and RAF-DB datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy and outperforming 
existing approaches in facial expression recognition.
